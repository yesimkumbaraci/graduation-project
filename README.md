# graduation-project
This repo consists of all materials related to my graduation project 'Decision Support System for Vehicle Control and Order Forecasting'.
The full system design report can be found in this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ajJVntJvOFy5OjRk69kt5KfhTUNgfTKU/view).

## Context
The project covers end-to-end cost optimization of the automotive industry customer's orders transported from Eastern Europe to Turkey.

## Project Components
1. Analysis of Problem Situation
2. Problem Definition & Data Collection
3. Literature Review
4. Technical Implementation (Preprocessing Data + Building Model)
5. Results on Impact

## Summary of Methodoly & Used Tools
* A decision support system is contstructed for our project that belongs to the "Multi-Criteria Decision Making" type of problem. 
* It uses ∆ê-method to represent the trade-off between the objectives (i.e. cost-delay trade off).
* Logistics data were used to provide the outputs of the mathematical model and make corresponding analyses.
* The model was run in Python language, Gurobi solver environment with the inputs taken from and output automatically sent to the Excel sheet.
* The excel sheet shows the schedule of trucks with corresponding fill rates, resulting in improved decision-making & time-saving through automation.
